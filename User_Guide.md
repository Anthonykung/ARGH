This device comes with four buttons to control the cameras attached to it. After plugging in the system and waiting for the screen to display fully the below actions should be available to be taken.


`Menu` - This button is used to switch between options. The currently selected option can be seen by looking at what line on the display has a > symbol to the left of it.

`Sel` - This button is used to confirm or activate settings.

`+` - This button is used to increment the time on the delay or recording time by 1 minute.

`-` - This button is used to decrement the time on the delay or recording time by 1 minute.


There are four option lines that can be interacted with in this system. They will be detailed in order from top to bottom of the display. The top line of the display will only display the system status and cannot be interacted with.

`Start/Stop Line` - This line can be used to manually start or stop the recording. The current status of the recording will be displayed on the top status line. Pressing the `Sel` button will start or stop the recording changing the status displayed at the top.

`Preset Delay Line` - This line is used to set a preset delay and also shows the current delay on the system. Pressing `+` or `-` while on this line will change the delay by 1 minute. This will also round the time down to the nearest minute. The time can be adjusted by any amount but to actually confirm this time change `Sel` must be pressed. The preset delay makes the system wait for a set amount of time before starting the recording.

`Recording Time Line` - This line is used to set the length of the recording. It also displays the current remaining time for recording. This time will not count down unless there is no remaining preset delay. Pressing `+` or `-` while on this line will change the length by 1 minute. This will also round the time down to the nearest minute. The time can be adjusted by any amount but to actually confirm this time change `Sel` must be pressed. The system will automatically stop recording when this reaches 0.

`Set to Last Picked Line` - This line can be used to set both the preset delay and the recording time to the most recently picked settings. Pressing `Sel` on this line will automatically update both settings.

> Note: It should be noted that recording will automatically restart any time the preset delay, recording time, or set to last picked lines are used.
